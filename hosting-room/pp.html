We will only share your information with third parties that agree to maintain the confidentiality of your information and to only use your information for purpose of providing the product or service as agreed upon by Hosting-Room .

We may share customer information obtained from customer surveys within our corporate family, and with trusted third parties to develop or provide products and services that we believe would be of interest to our customers. Domain Registration. In certain jurisdictions or pursuant to the rules of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") or certain registries, the contact information you provide to register a domain name (“Domain Name Registration Information”) has to be made available and accessible to the public through a "WHOIS" search. The WHOIS database is a publicly accessible database that lists the Domain Name Registration Information for a particular domain name, the name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain name's creation and expiration date. The Domain Name Registration Information you provide is hosted by us or a third party service provider and is made available to the public through the WHOIS database. At times, customers may receive solicitations that result from searches of the publicly available WHOIS database by other companies or individuals. Any such solicitations or SPAM do not come from Hosting-Room and we do not control the use of WHOIS information by third parties. Further, pursuant to ICANN rules, Hosting-Room is required to make WHOIS data available to any third party that enters into a bulk access agreement. While ICANN allows individuals to opt-out (using the account management panel, domain management console or similar service) of having their WHOIS information made available to third parties through bulk access, companies, such as ours, and other organizations do not have the ability to opt-out of having their information made available to a third party that enters into a bulk access agreement. We may also deposit your Domain Name Registration Information with a third-party escrow provider to comply with ICANN requirements. Law Enforcement and Special Cases. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose information about users upon a valid request by government or law officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe is necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas) or as otherwise required to comply with applicable laws. We may also disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against a party that threatens us, our systems or our customers (for example, to prevent a Distributed Denial of Service or “DDoS”, attack).

If Hosting-Room is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email or through a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>			</div>
