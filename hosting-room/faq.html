                    <h4>1. General technical issues.</h4>
                    <p><b>do You support the ability to assign multiple IP addresses to the dedicated one (dedicated) or virtual server (VDS)?</b><br> You can order up to 8 IP addresses on a dedicated (dedicated) or virtual server (VDS).</p>
                    <p><b>What control panel do you provide services?</b><br>- the management is through the hosting panel ISPmanager
                        <br>- managing virtual servers (VDS) as the iron (restart, stop, etc.) is carried out through VDSmanager, to administer the VDS You can install the prepared images with built<br>-in and customized panels VestaCP (free) or ISPmanager 5 Lite (surcharge) upon request
                        <br>- the management of dedicated servers as the hardware (restart, stop, etc.) is carried out through DCImanager, to administer the VDS You can install the prepared images with built<br>-in and customized panel ISPmanager 5 Lite (surcharge) upon request
                        You can put any control panel, which is considered necessary as we provide root access on the server.</p>
                    <p><b>You provide the service of data backup (backup)?</b><br>No, but we are working on it. In the near future You will be able to get ftp repository for backups of all the information You need.

                        For virtual servers (VDS) there is implicit redundancy through the mirroring of the repositories. And to save the machines state prior to important changes, You can use the snapshots (snapshot). We have not yet determined whether to enable the ability to create backups in the control panel server, because for a correct and complete copy of Your virtual machine, it is necessary to suspend that will interrupt the running of the services.

                        We recommend You to use for free data backup virtual disks, such as Google Drive, One drive, Mail.ru disc, BOX, etc.</p>

                        Backup server does not guarantee maintaining the same IP address that was assigned to You.
                        Virtual hosting (shared hosting) by itself implies that many sites are under one IP, because in that case, Your IP will not be allocated to You personally.</p>
                    <p><b>What are your security settings (security settings) by default (ports, firewalls)?</b><br>By default, all ports open, no restrictions from our side. We encourage customers to set their own security settings and to ensure the security of their services.</p>

                    <p><b>What is your architecture and technical implementation?</b><br>Despite the low prices, our architecture is similar failover clustering (high-availability cluster), which is built using tested for years in production of open and commercial software (software) and iron (hardware).
                        <br>- All servers are running on CentOS 6, which ensures a homogeneous environment and simplifies administration and security.
                        <br>- All services are run on clusters.
                        <br>- All cluster standard.
                        <br>- Standard cluster is a node-based server Dell c6100 server with 6-core Intel Xeon processors and storage based on Supermicro servers with 6-core Intel Xeon and SSD RAID 5 controller based on LSI.
                        <br>- Cluster is served by switches, Juniper and IBM, and is connected via 10Gbps uplink.
                        <br>- Each node is connected with two 1Gbps interfaces to provide fault tolerance for the physical link and provides the ability to create internal virtual links between virtual machines to 40Gbps.
                        <br>- Storage connected by iSCSI 10Gbps interfaces.</p>
