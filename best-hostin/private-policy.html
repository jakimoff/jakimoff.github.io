We may share your information with these parties to offer the product or service or to facilitate your use of additional features included with your hosting account. For example, one of our partners may provide services to you through a link that you access from your control panel.

                                    We may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from customers to potential partners, reputable third parties and other companies or brands within our corporate family.

We may share aggregated and non-identifying information about our customers that we collect through the registration process or through online surveys and promotions with certain advertisers. In some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements.

Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended audience.

                                    Domain Registration. In certain jurisdictions or pursuant to the rules of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") or certain registries, the contact information you provide to register a domain name (“Domain Name Registration Information”) has to be made available and accessible to the public through a "WHOIS" search. The WHOIS database is a publicly accessible database that lists the Domain Name Registration Information for a particular domain name, the name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain name's creation and expiration date. The Domain Name Registration Information you provide is hosted by us or a third party service provider and is made available to the public through the WHOIS database. At times, customers may receive solicitations that result from searches of the publicly available WHOIS database by other companies or individuals. Any such solicitations or SPAM do not come from Best-Hostin and we do not control the use of WHOIS information by third parties. Further, pursuant to ICANN rules, Best-Hostin is required to make WHOIS data available to any third party that enters into a bulk access agreement. While ICANN allows individuals to opt-out (using the account management panel, domain management console or similar service) of having their WHOIS information made available to third parties through bulk access, companies, such as ours, and other organizations do not have the ability to opt-out of having their information made available to a third party that enters into a bulk access agreement. We may also deposit your Domain Name Registration Information with a third-party escrow provider to comply with ICANN requirements.
                                    Law Enforcement and Special Cases. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose information about users upon a valid request by government or law officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe is necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas) or as otherwise required to comply with applicable laws. We may also disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against a party that threatens us, our systems or our customers (for example, to prevent a Distributed Denial of Service or “DDoS”, attack).
                                    Mergers, Sale or other Asset Transfer. If Best-Hostin is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email or through a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
